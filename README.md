AKA Yet Another AutoIt Deobfuscator

!!! Project discontinued !!!

No one worked on it, I've done just a simple deob for the files crypted with the .tbl method, I just upload it here.


Compiling
=====

Compile is pretty easy, just clone the repository and open it in SharpDevelop (I think ms visual studio works too), then select the Release as target and press the build button.
