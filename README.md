=== NOTES 4 DEVELOPERS ===

Okay everything changed, now it will probably be a decompiler too beacause exe2aut fucked up.
I will (try to) work on the decompilying part, the AutoIt interpretation and deobfuscating part will be done later or by someone of you (Speedjack :3)
We want to interpretate the AutoIt scripts so we can do the deobfuscation better.
Thank you for helping us.

Sorry for bad english,
V0K3.
