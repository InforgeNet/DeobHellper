NOTE: This project is still in development.
NOTE: If you want to become a developer just send me an email: v0k3@inventati.org

=== NOTES 4 DEVELOPERS ===

Hello, this is a deobfuscator based on signatures, you can find the obfuscators that we are working on in the "obfuscators" folder.
Right now the first thing we need to do (imho) is to write a SignatureLooker and then fill up a SignaturesDatabase.
The project will be developed on C#, if you want to contribute just send me a message :D
You can find more infos on the TODO file.

Sorry for bad english,
V0K3.
